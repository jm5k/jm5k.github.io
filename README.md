A suite of minimalist, client-side time tools that visualize your day as a single continuous line — extended with timers, stopwatches, multi-timezone support, themes, and focus-tracking utilities.  
Built by **[jm5k](https://linearclocklab.com/)** using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no dependencies, and no tracking.

The project uses a small hybrid foundation: stable design tokens and reused components live in `lcl.css`, pure multi-page time formatting lives in `lcl-time.js`, and each tool keeps its own inline layout and controller logic.

## 🗺️ Project Structure
- `index.html` — Main Linear Clock  
- `clock.html` — Minimal View  
- `lcl.css` — Shared design tokens and reusable UI foundations
- `lcl-time.js` — Pure shared clock-formatting utilities
- `multi-clock.html` — Multi-Timezone Clocks  
- `focus.html` — FocusLine Pomodoro  
- `clock_presets.html` — Theme and Color Presets  
- `timer.html` — Countdown Timer  
- `stopwatch.html` — Stopwatch  
- `about.html` — Overview, roadmap, and license  
- `tests/time-utils.test.js` — Dependency-free Node tests for shared time formatting
- `tests/site-audit.test.js` — Sitemap-driven public-page metadata and asset audit

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the dependency-free Node checks directly:

```text
node tests/time-utils.test.js
node tests/site-audit.test.js
```

The time utility tests protect shared formatting behavior. The site audit
protects public-page metadata, navigation, copyright, sitemap coverage, shared
script ordering, and local asset references.
